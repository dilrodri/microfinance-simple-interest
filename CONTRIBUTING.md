# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing! All **contributions**, **bug reports**, **bug fixes**, **documentation improvements**, **enhancements**, and **new ideas** are welcome.

## How to report a bug or request a feature
- Open a GitHub Issue with a clear title and description.
- Include steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, environment details, and any logs or screenshots that help.

## How to propose a change
1. **Fork** this repository and create a branch from `main`:
   - `feat/<short-description>` for new features
   - `fix/<short-description>` for bug fixes
   - `docs/<short-description>` for documentation-only changes
2. Make your changes and add/update tests or examples when applicable.
3. Follow the code style and keep the code well commented.
4. Write clear commit messages (e.g., *feat: add validation for interest inputs*).
5. **Open a Pull Request**:
   - Reference related issues (e.g., `Closes #123`).
   - Provide a concise summary of what changed and why.
   - Check that CI (if any) is passing.

## Code style & scope
- Keep functions simple and focused.
- Favor clarity over cleverness; add comments where intent is not obvious.
- For shell and Markdown, keep lines readable and avoid trailing whitespace.

## Documentation
- Update the `README.md` if your change affects usage or configuration.
- Add examples where helpful.
